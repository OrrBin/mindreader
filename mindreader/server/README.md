## server
The server receives snapshots from the client, and is responsible to handle them.
It can also post them to a message queue, to be consumable by the parsers. 

It provides the following functions:
* `run_server`: starts the server, and handles cognition snapshots received from client. It receives the following arguments:
    * `host`: server host, to listen in
    * `port`: server port
    * `publish`: an handler (function) to the snapshots. Each time a snapshot is received, this function will be called
    with the user (of it) and the snapshot
    
    Example usage:    
    ```pycon
    >>> from mindreader.server import run_server
    >>> def print_snapshot(user, snapshot):
    ...     print(f'User: {user}, Snapshot: {snapshot}')
    >>> run_server(host='127.0.0.1', port=8000, publish=print_snapshot)
    # Listening on 127.0.0.1:8000
    ```
  
    It is also consumable by a CLI, where the host and port are optional (default to the shown here), but instead
    of a handler, it receives a path to a message queue, where it posts the user/snapshot data:
    ```sh
    [mindreader] $ python -m mindreader.server -h/--host '127.0.0.1' -p/--port 8000 \
    -d/--data-dir /my/data/dir rabbitmq://127.0.0.1:5672/'  # The prefix indicates the message queue type
    ... # Listening on 127.0.0.1:8000, passing messages to rabbit mq at 127.0.0.1:5672 
    ```

    The `-d` flag is used to change the directory, in which data that is generated by the server is saved into.
    If not supplied, to default is the project root directory, under 'mindreader_internal_data'.
